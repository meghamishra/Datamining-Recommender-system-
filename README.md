# Recommendation system algorithms implementation 
Implemented the following algorithms for recommendation problem formulated as Multi-arm bandit for stochastic and non-stochastic cases.

a. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB algorithm) \
b. e-greedy \
c. Thompson Sampling \
d. Multiplicative weight update \
e. EXP-3 

# Online Clustering
Yelp Movie dataset was used and clustered using stochastic K-means++ for better initialization and faster convergence

a. K-means \
b. K-means ++
